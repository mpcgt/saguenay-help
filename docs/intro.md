## What is Saguenay?

Saguenay is a social network designed to respect your privacy and promote the well-being of its users. Unlike many existing platforms, we don't monitor your activity to influence you or control what you see. In fact, Saguenay is algorithm-free: there's no sorting mechanism that selects posts for you, which means we don't know what you like, what you don't like, or what might capture your attention. Our users can enjoy an authentic online experience, where their interactions are neither monitored nor manipulated for commercial gain.

## User well-being: a priority üéØ

Saguenay goes further to encourage healthy and balanced use of the platform. We've integrated a timer that alerts users when they're spending too much time on the network, to help them maintain moderate, mindful use. This wellness-focused approach is rare in social networking, where most platforms seek to extend your screen time to maximize revenue. At Saguenay, there's no advertising. Your data is not collected to target you with ads, nor is it sold to third parties. We take great care to ensure that your privacy is protected: there are no tracking devices, and we never share your personal information.

## Safety and Moderation: A Rigorous Approach üîí

Our commitment to security and content moderation is equally uncompromising. Saguenay has a rigorous process for detecting and banning users who post violent, pornographic, or extremist content. Vulnerable users who violate our community guidelines are immediately sanctioned, ensuring a healthier and safer environment for all. In addition, the platform enables you to create or join groups based on your passions and interests, promoting authentic and enriching exchanges without fear of your data being exploited.

## Open-Source and Transparency: A Committed Community ‚úäüèª

In addition to its commitment to privacy, Saguenay is an open-source platform, which means that its code is accessible and verifiable by all. This transparency ensures that we have nothing to hide and allows the community to contribute to the continuous improvement of the platform. Unlike other social networks that exploit your personal data to maximize their profits, Saguenay is committed to providing a space where users are in control, without worrying about collecting data for profit. Our servers are hosted in the European Union and comply with strict data protection regulations, giving you an extra layer of privacy.

## An Ethical Model: Putting the User First ‚ú®

Saguenay distinguishes itself from other social networks by refusing to sacrifice user privacy in favor of a business model based on advertising and attention control. Where other platforms seek to capture your attention for as long as possible, while using and sharing your data to generate revenue every second, Saguenay lets you remain in control of your online experience. Choosing Saguenay means opting for a social network that puts you and your privacy first.
